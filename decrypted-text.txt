Thank you for looking the other way on the increased levels of toxic chemicals in the river running alongside our industrial facilities. You can pick up your payment of $20,000 in the mailbox at the mansion on the corner of 53 and St. Charles tomorrow between the hours of 3:00am and 5:00am.



Thank you,
